Since v0.2.8, I've been using GoReleaser to release Rio, which makes my life so much easier.
Before, I had a mix of local (and manual) work with an automated pipeline.
In the automation side, I didn't have support to `.rpm` packages, and still had to update a couple of files with the new version. 
Frankly, it's the kind of work I don't want to do for every release.

GoReleaser is a release automation tool. It currently supports Go, Rust, Zig, and TypeScript (with Bun and Deno). 
GoReleaser was created to solve a problem we all had at some point: releasing software is boring and error prone.

Rio wouldn't be using GoReleaser without the awesome work of [Vedant Mohan Goyal](https://github.com/vedantmgoyal9) and [Carlos Alexandro Becker](https://github.com/caarlos0).
Speaking of which, Vedant is writing a blog post about migrating the Rio pipeline to GoReleaser - seriously go follow him!

That's it for today folks :)
